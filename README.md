## Examples of Good ChatBots

### 1. Woebot (Mental Health Companion)

> **This application used to be available in Korea, but it is no longer accessible now. Therefore, I cannot show the detailed interface, but I can list some examples based on my memory of using Woebot.**

**Users interact with Woebot in 2 ways**

*1> by typing in whatever text they’d like*

*2> by choosing prewritten responses.*

**My Personal Experience [*]:**

[*]: Just based on my memory, not fully aligned with the application’s actual responses.

> **Me**: *I’m feeling very bad now, I am so angry.*
>> **Woebot**: *I hear you. Would you like to tell me what happened with you? Maybe I can help you.*
>
> **Me**: *Not now, I am really angry and I feel that I cannot breath. How can they do this to me.*
>> **Woebot**: *Then maybe you can tell me about that when you feel better. Want to try a short breathing exercise together?*
>
> **Me**: Fine.
>> **Woebot**: [Breathing exercise]
>> **Woebot**: *Feel better now? Do you want to tell me what happened now?*
>
> **Me**: [......Share my feeling and things happened to me......]
>> **Woebot**: *It sounds like you’re going through a tough time in your relationship. Did I understand that correctly?*

🟢 **Why it's good**:  

- Shows empathy, such as emoji, empathy expressions, etc.
- Offers practical support.  
- Responds to emotional context.
- I never felt like I was “doing therapy”.

⚠️ **Something Limited**:

- Sometimes my responses had to fit into pre-scripted “boxes”. --> This is related with the first way of its response.
- The beginner-level information was redundant and boring.

### 2. Duolingo Max: *Voice Conversations with Lily* (Education / Language Learning)

> **I am not sure if it really can be counted as a chatbot (maybe a conversational agent), but I really like it.**
