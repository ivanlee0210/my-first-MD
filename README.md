## Examples of Good Chatbots

### 1. Woebot (Mental Health Companion)

> **This application used to be available in Korea, but it is no longer accessible now. Therefore, I cannot show the detailed interface, but I can list some examples based on my memory of using Woebot.**

### Users interact with Woebot in 2 ways

1. By typing in whatever text they’d like.

![Woebot Screenshot from Internet 1](https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/screenshot-of-woebot-a-mental-health-app-showing-conversation-between-a-chatbot-and-a-user.png?id=52317967&alt=a%20text%20interaction%20on%20a%20phone.&width=250&quality=100)

2. By choosing prewritten responses.

**My Personal Experience [*]:**

[*]: Just based on my memory, not fully aligned with the application’s actual responses.

```
Me: I’m feeling very bad now, I am so angry.
  Woebot: I hear you. Would you like to tell me what happened with you? Maybe I can help you.
Me: Not now, I am really angry and I feel that I cannot breath. How can they do this to me.
  Woebot: Then maybe you can tell me about that when you feel better. Want to try a short breathing exercise together?
Me: Fine.
  Woebot: [Breathing exercise]
  Woebot: Feel better now? Do you want to tell me what happened now?
Me: [......Share my feeling and things happened to me......]
  Woebot: It sounds like you’re going through a tough time in your relationship. Did I understand that correctly?
```

🟢 **Why it's good**:  

- Shows empathy, such as emoji, empathy expressions, etc.
- Offers practical support.  
- Responds to emotional context.
- I never felt like I was “doing therapy”.

⚠️ **Something Limited**:

- Sometimes my responses had to fit into pre-scripted “boxes”. --> This is related with the first way of its response.
- The beginner-level information was redundant and boring.

### 2. Duolingo Max: *Voice Conversations with Lily* (Education / Language Learning)

> **I am not sure if it really can be counted as a chatbot (maybe a conversational agent), but I really like it.**

### 3. China Mobile Smart Assistant (AI-Driven Customer Service)

> **This is a chatbot I recently used via China Mobile’s official platform. It is AI-powered and supports both voice and text input.**

---

***Use Case**:I wanted to apply for a new SIM card.*

>**Experience Flow**:
>>- I typed in my request: *"I want to get a new SIM card."*
>>- The chatbot immediately understood the intent and **redirected me to the correct service page**.
>>- It also used **voice playback**, saying: *“I’ve found the following page for you. Please check if it meets your need.”*
>>- On the redirected page, a **floating avatar button** remained visible in the corner, allowing me to continue chatting at any time without going back.

🟢 **Why it's good**:

- *Multi-modal input.*
- *Immediate intent recognition.*
- *Human-like guidance.*
- *Persistent presence.*
- *Task-oriented design.*

📌 *This kind of chatbot shows how AI can enhance customer experience through seamless service integration and proactive assistance.*

## 💔 Examples of Bad Chatbot

> **Recently, chatbots have improved significantly, making it difficult to find clear examples of poor performance. Therefore, the following examples are based on my past experiences.**

### 1. Banking Application Chatbot

```
User: I want to check last month’s credit card bill.
  ChatBot: Are you applying for a new credit card?
```

🔴 **What's wrong**:

1. Keyword-based misunderstanding.
2. Ignores user’s actual intent.

---

### 2. E-commerce Customer Service Bot

```
User: The mug I ordered arrived broken. I need a refund.
  ChatBot: Your order has been delivered. Thank you!
```

🔴 **What's wrong**:  

1. Doesn’t register the problem.  
2. No apology or next steps offered.  

---

### 3. Kingobot

> ***It used to be bad, but now it become more useful.***

```
User: Today's menu.
  ChatBot: 귀하의 요청을 이해할 수 없습니다.
```

🔴 **What's wrong**:

1. Doesn't understand user's request or perform requested action.
2. Gives a generic, irrelevant response.
3. Cannot provide response in language that user used.

✅ **New Advancement**:

> - The first two problems seem to be solved, but still is not so friendly for international studnets.
